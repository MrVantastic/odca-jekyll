    name: Sugar-Sweetened BeverageTax
    title: Sugar-Sweetened BeverageTax
    summary: >-
      This measure would impose a tax on the distribution of Sugar-Sweetened
      Beverage Products in Oakland. Sugar-Sweetened beverages are defined as any
      beverage to which one or more Caloric Sweeteners have been added and that
      contain 25 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage. The tax would
      not be imposed on infant or baby formula, beverages for medical use,
      supplemental, meal replacement, or nutritional beverages, milk products,
      fruit or vegetable juices with no added sweeteners, or alcoholic
      beverages. The measure would require that any distributor of
      sugar-sweetened beverages register with the City and establish a Community
      Advisory Board. The Board would be responsible for making recommendations
      to the City Council on setting up or funding programs that prevent or
      reduce the health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages.

    name: Just Cause for Eviction and Rent Adjustment
    title: Just Cause for Eviction and Rent Adjustment
    summary: >-
      This measure would: (1) extend the just cause eviction requirements to
      rental units constructed and approved for occupancy before December 31,
      1995, if the units were newly constructed from the group and not created
      by rehabilitating, improving, or converting pre-existing commercial space
      or other residential rental space; (2) amend the Rent Ordinance to require
      that landlords obtain approval from the Rent Program before imposing any
      rent increases exceeding the Consumer Price Index. Without advance
      approval, landlords could not make tenants pay any rent increases noticed
      on or after February 1, 2017 exceeding the allowable adjustment. In
      addition the measure would require the City to provide an annual notice to
      residents that would include the amount of the allowable cost-of-living
      rent adjustment for the year while explaining how to get information for a
      rent increase.

      the property. The City would impose a tax based on the value of real
      property and improvements within the City to pay the principal and
      interest of the bonds. The City would use this money to build, buy,
      improve, and rehabilitate facilities and infrastructure and for affordable
      housing in Oakland. The projects financed by the bonds would be completed

      would be required to investigate complaints involving use of force,

      be independently appointed by a panel of Oakland residents with subpoena
      power and five commissioners could vote to fire the chief.
