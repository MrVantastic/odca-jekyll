    <p>
      This site pulls data from the City of Oakland’s campaign finance reporting database to produce easy to understand 
      graphs that clearly show the source of campaign funds and how they are being spent to sway election results. Our goal is 
      to increase government transparency by revealing the potential influence behind local politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope to raise awareness, promote electoral accountability, and promote civic engagement and 
      political participation by Oakland residents.
