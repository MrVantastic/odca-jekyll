  <p class="landing__description__paragraph">
    This site pulls data from the City of Oaklandâ€™s campaign finance reporting database to produce easy to understand 
    graphs that clearly show the source of campaign funds and how they are being spent to sway election results. Our goal is 
    to increase government transparency by revealing the potential influence behind local politics.
  </p>
  <p class="landing__description__paragraph">
    We hope to raise awareness, promote electoral accountability, and promote civic engagement and 
    political participation by Oakland residents.
