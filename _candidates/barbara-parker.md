Barbara Parker was appointed City Attorney in 2011 after the retirement of then-City Attorney John Russo. Prior to becoming City Attorney, Parker served for 20 years in the Oakland City Attorney’s Office, including ten years as Chief Assistant City Attorney. Parker graduated from Harvard Law in 1975 and has worked as an attorney in the private sector for two major corporations and two prominent law firms. She has served as the manager of a large public agency and as an attorney at all levels of government—federal, state, and local—including more than five years as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, where she represented the U.S. in federal court litigation. In 2005, the State Bar Board of Governors selected Parker for an appointment to the State Judicial Council.
