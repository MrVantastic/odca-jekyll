title: About the Open Disclosure California Project
---

Open Disclosure California (ODCA) was created to support transparency and integrity in elections. We reveal influence on candidates running for office and supporting and opposing parties of ballot measures by publishing financial data collected by local governments in a manner that is comprehensible and accessible to the general public. By revealing the flow of money in politics, ODCA empowers citizens and strengthens democracy by holding elected officials accountable. By revealing potential issues with how campaign funds are raised and spent, ODCA raises the standard of clarity and transparency of Oakland’s local campaign finance so the public can better understand how local campaigns are financed and cultivate trust in our electoral system.

ODCA pulls the raw data for money accepted from candidate and ballot committees and on spending by those committees when they submit their campaign finance filings to [NetFile](https://public.netfile.com/pub2/Default.aspx?aid=COAK&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1), Oakland’s campaign finance disclosure database. Election committees must file according to [Oakland’s Campaign Contribution Limits](https://www.oaklandca.gov/services/boards-and-commissions-index/ethics/campaign-finance-rules-and-disclosure/information-for-candidates-and-campaign-committees/oakland-campaign-contribution-limits) and following deadlines set forth by the [California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC)](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/). ODCA then visualizes that data to show relationships and connections with funders. ODCA does not clean or editorialize the data prior to publishing it. The [first version](http://2014.opendisclosure.io/) of Open Disclosure visualized money in the 2014 Oakland mayoral election. ODCA now includes data for all offices and measures on the ballot. 

ODCA is developed by [OpenOakland](http://openoakland.org/), a [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) citizen brigade that works to improve the lives of Oaklanders by advancing civic innovation and open government through community partnerships, engaged volunteers, and civic technology. This project has been developed in partnership with the [Oakland Public Ethics Commission (PEC)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-and-commissions/public-ethics-commission) since 2014. The PEC is an independent commission made up of Oakland residents and charged with ensuring fairness, openness, honesty and integrity in Oakland City government.

All development on OpenDisclosure happens publicly on [Github](https://github.com/caciviclab/odca-jekyll). We’re always seeking volunteers to contribute to our project and support civic tech.
